6. FAQ
------------------------------------------------------------

Q: The program starts in the wrong folder.
A: MediaExplorer uses its own folder as the root. Move the MediaExplorer folder to your preferred root location.

Q: My folder thumbnails are missing.
A: Thumbnails are saved in the 'folder_thumbs' folder. Do not delete or move it. Moving MediaExplorer to another location breaks thumbnail paths.

Q: Large folders load slowly.
A: Initial load may be slow. Thumbnails are cached for faster access next time.

Q: The program crashes while loading.
A: Wait for the spinner to stop before clicking. Heavy interaction during loading may cause instability.

Q: Some thumbnails didn't load.
A: Some files may have timed out. Click 'Update File Thumbs' or re-enter the folder. Some videos may appear black due to dark thumbnail frames.
